\section{Market Survey}
To comprehend the scope and orientation of the system, it’s essential to conduct a market survey of similar systems. Pet adoption systems, each with its unique features and benefits, come in various forms. In Vietnam, however, most organizations in this field operate through social network pages like Facebook and Instagram, rather than standalone software systems. Notably, the only pet adoption system that stands out from the rest is Hanoi Pet Adoption, which warrants further analysis and evaluation.

\subsection{Overview}
\subsubsection*{Hanoi Pet Adoption}
To comprehend the scope and orientation of the system, it’s essential to conduct a market survey of similar systems. We decided to choose the three below websites as our main targets for analysis and evaluation:
\textbf{Hanoi Pet Adoption}, \textbf{PetRescue}, and \textbf{PetFinder}, each representing Vietnam, Australia, and the United States.

HPA has the following main features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Pet profiles:} The system showcases profiles of animals ready for adoption. These profiles include details such as photos, names, genders, ages, colors, and sterilization statuses.
  \item \textit{Dual languages support:} The site has both English and Vietnamese languages available.
  \item \textit{Blogs:}  The system provides blogs about training tips, news, pet health care,...
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{PetRescue}

Based in Australia, PetRescue is a widely recognized non-profit organization dedicated to finding homes for rescued pets. The platform connects thousands of rescue groups, shelters, and pounds across Australia, offering a central repository for adoptable animals.

PetRescue's key features include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Comprehensive Pet Listings}: The platform provides detailed profiles for each animal, including photos, descriptions, ages, breeds, and health statuses.
  \item \textit{Adoption Stories}: PetRescue features success stories of adopted animals, which helps to promote adoption and provide reassurance to potential adopters.
  \item \textit{Educational Resources}: The site offers extensive resources on pet care, behavior, and training, helping new pet owners to integrate their pets into their homes successfully.
  \item \textit{Support for Rescue Organizations}: PetRescue supports rescue groups by offering them tools to manage their pet listings and connect with potential adopters, enhancing their ability to find homes for rescued animals.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{PetFinder}

PetFinder, a prominent online resource in the United States, is dedicated to promoting pet adoption by connecting potential adopters with a vast network of animal shelters and rescue organizations. The platform's goal is to reduce the number of homeless pets and to advocate for responsible pet ownership.

Here are some of PetFinder's key features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Extensive Pet Database}: PetFinder hosts an extensive database of adoptable pets, featuring detailed profiles with photos, descriptions, breed information, and adoption requirements.
  \item \textit{Mobile Application}: The platform offers a mobile app, allowing users to browse and inquire about adoptable pets on-the-go.
  \item \textit{Adoption Resources}: PetFinder provides a wealth of information on the adoption process, pet care tips, and training advice.
  \item \textit{Shelter and Rescue Support}: PetFinder offers tools and resources for shelters and rescue groups to manage their listings and reach a broader audience, increasing their chances of finding homes for their animals.
\end{itemize}

By analyzing these systems, we gain valuable insights into the functionalities, strengths, and areas for improvement that can guide the development of our own platform, ensuring it meets the needs of both the animals and the adopters effectively.

\subsection{Evaluation}
\subsubsection*{Hanoi Pet Adoption}

HPA provides a comprehensive and effective pet adoption support process. However, its limitation lies in its exclusivity - only system administrators of the organization are permitted to post pet profiles onto the system.

Currently, the system requires manual input for posting, filtering, and searching functions. This can pose challenges for individual users, potentially reducing the efficiency of posting and searching, and negatively impacting the user experience.

Lastly, a significant feature that is absent in the system is a notification system. Such a system would alert users when pets that meet their criteria are posted, ensuring that users are promptly informed about potential matches. This feature could greatly enhance the user experience and effectiveness of the pet adoption process.

\subsubsection*{PetFinder}

With extensive database and mobile app, PetFinder provides a highly accessible and efficient platform for pet adoption. The detailed pet profiles and extensive adoption resources help users make informed decisions. The mobile application adds convenience, allowing users to browse adoptable pets on the go. However, PetFinder encounters a crucial problem which is the long loading time, it took over 10-15 seconds to load the application. This problem may severely affect the user experience.

\subsubsection*{PetRescue}

PetRescue may be the one closest to perfection in terms of pet adoption application. Its extensive pet listings and success stories not only promote pet adoption but also build trust and engagement with users. The educational resources and support for rescue organizations further enhance their effectiveness. The only downside of this application is that it has been around for a long time so the UI/UX is quite outdated.


\subsection{Improvements and Adaptions}

After a thorough review of the strengths and weaknesses of existing systems, we have identified several potential enhancements that could significantly improve the user experience and functionality of the system.

Firstly, we propose to \textbf{expand the HPA system}. Currently, the pets are only posted by system administrators. However, SGT aims to allow individuals wishing to surrender their pets to proactively post about their pets for adoption. This expansion would not only increase the number of pets available for adoption but also provide a platform for pet owners and organizations to share valuable information and updates about their pets.

Secondly, we suggest the implementation of \textbf{interactive pet profiles} with user friendly UI/UX. This feature would allow users to visit and interact with pet profiles and posts. This interaction could include liking, commenting, or sharing a pet’s profile.

Next, we recommend \textbf{applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to enhance the posting and searching} functionality of the system. With this feature, users could simply upload a pet image, and the AI would automatically populate most of the input fields, such as breed, and color. This would not only simplify the process of posting a pet profile but also increase the accuracy and consistency of the pet information in the system.

In addition, we also want to adapt the \textbf{management tools for organizations} like PetRescue and PetFinder, offering tools and resources for rescue groups to manage their pet listings and interact with potential adopters will streamline the adoption process and support the efforts of these organizations.

Lastly, we propose the implementation of a \textbf{notification system}. This system would alert users when a pet that matches their preferences becomes available on the system. User criteria for filtering pet profiles (such as breed, age, or size) will be referenced, and then users can receive notifications when a matching pet is posted. This would ensure that users don’t miss out on potential matches and can act quickly to adopt their desired pet.

In conclusion, these enhancements aim to make the system more user-friendly, efficient, and effective in connecting pets with potential adopters. We believe that by implementing these changes, we can take a significant step toward our goal of finding a loving and suitable home for every pet.

\section{Stakeholders}
Stakeholders for a project focused on creating a pet adoption platform in Vietnam would include a diverse range of individuals, organizations, and groups with an interest in or influence over the project. Here are some key stakeholders:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Administrator:} The administrator is responsible for managing and overseeing the platform's operations. They have control over user accounts, content moderation, and the overall functionality of the website.
  \item \textit{Pet Adopter:} Pet adopters are individuals looking to provide a loving home to pets available for adoption. They may already own pets or be first-time pet owners. Pet adopters interact with pet owners and adoption agencies through messaging and inquiries about available pets. They can also share their adoption stories and experiences with the platform's community.
  \item \textit{Pet Owner:} Pet owners are individuals who currently own and care for pets, including dogs, cats, or other animals. Or those, for various reasons, have decided to give their pets to new homes. Reasons may include relocation, financial constraints, allergies, or changes in life circumstances.
  \item \textit{Guest:} Guests are individuals who visit the platform without creating an account or logging in. They have limited access to platform features and content. Guests can browse public content, view pet listings, read provided blogs, and explore the platform's resources. They can also choose to create an account to access more features.
  \item \textit{Pet Adoption Agencies and Shelters:} Organizations involved in pet adoption, rescue, and rehoming would benefit from the platform as it could help them find suitable homes for abandoned or rescued animals. They might also contribute content and listings.
  \item \textit{Pet-Related Businesses:} Pet stores, pet food suppliers, grooming salons, veterinary clinics, and other businesses in the pet industry have a stake in the project. They could use the platform to advertise their products and services to a targeted audience.
  \item \textit{Veterinarians:} Veterinarians play a crucial role in pet healthcare. They might use the platform to provide information, answer questions, and offer telehealth services. Their expertise can be valuable to pet owners.
  \item \textit{Investors and Funders:} Individuals or organizations providing funding or investment for the development and scaling of the platform are stakeholders with a financial interest.
\end{itemize}

Understanding and engaging with these stakeholders will be important for the success and sustainability of the project. Each stakeholder group may have different needs, interests, and concerns that should be addressed during the project's planning and execution.

  \caption{Login with a Google account activity diagram}
  \label{fig:login-google}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Update to Organization account}

The use case starts when an individual user chooses to update to organization accounts, then a form will be displayed. Then, users provide some information for verification and submit them. After the update-account application is verified by admins, the system updates the account and notifies the user of the results.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/update_org.png}
  \caption{Update to Organization account activity diagram}
  \label{fig:update-org}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Manage pet profile}

The use case starts when a user accesses the pet profile management page. The user chooses to edit or create a new profile and a form will be displayed. Note that the form would be filled if the user chose to edit an available profile. In that case, the user can modify the fields or rather delete the profile. Otherwise, the user can input the pet information and submit it. The user can also fill in pet breeds and colors by providing images. Finally, the content of the form will be verified, and the result will be displayed.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/manage_pet.png}
  \caption{Manage pet profile activity diagram}
  \label{fig:manage-pet}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Access pet profile}

In the pet profile page, a user has options to find pets by filtering by categories or providing pet images. In case the user filters by images, those images will be processed by the Pet Recognition Service. Then, the filtered pet profiles will be displayed to the user. The user can click on pet profiles for further information or continue finding other pet profiles.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/access_pet.png}
  \caption{Access pet profile activity diagram}
  \label{fig:access-pet}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Adopt pets}

After finding a pet profile successfully, if the pet is still available, a user can choose to adopt the pet by filling in the required information in the adoption form and sending it. The application form will be reviewed by the pet owner. The result will be sent to the user then. Note that, the user can still contact directly to the pet owner during the pet adoption process.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/adopt_pet.png}
  \caption{Adopt pets activity diagram}
  \label{fig:adopt-pet}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Interact with posts}

After accessing a pet profile successfully, a user can also see public posts of the pet. The user can choose a post for further information and leave their comments or likes on the post. Note that the private posts can only be seen by the pet owner and admins.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/post_interact.png}
  \caption{Interact with posts activity diagram}
  \label{fig:interact-post}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Update pet status}

Updating the status of a pet is uploading posts about it. The use case starts when an owner can select a pet profile and choose the option of updating the pet status. After filling information, the owner can set visibility for the post. Finally, the user can send the form and a new post is created.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/pet_status.png}
  \caption{Update pet status activity diagram}
  \label{fig:update-pet-status}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Manage blogs for Organizations}

The use case starts when a user with an Organization account accesses the blog management page. The user chooses to edit or create a new blog, then a form will be displayed. Note that the form would be filled if the user chose to edit an available blog. In that case, the user can modify the fields or rather delete the blog. If the user wants to create a new blog, the user can input and submit it. Finally, admins will verify the blog and the result will be sent to the user.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Class Diagrams}

The system design is expected to adhere to the Layered and Repository
design patterns as outlined in \emph{\textbf{section 3.1}}.
Consequently, the system's classes are categorized into four distinct
groups.

\emph{View Classes} (Figure 21): These classes encompass the user
interface and user experience (UI/UX) components, along with methods for
handling user events. Each class inherits from a common class,
\emph{BaseLayout}, which encapsulates the components and methods shared
across all view classes.

\emph{Service Classes} (Figure 22): These classes contain methods for
processing the system's logic and business flow. Each class has a
specific responsibility and inherits from a class called
\emph{BaseService}, which encapsulates the methods and services common
to all service classes. The methods of service classes are made
available to view classes via an Application Programming Interface
(API).

\emph{DataLayer Classes} (Figure 23): Each class corresponds to a system
entity in the database. All DataLayer classes inherit from a class
called \emph{BaseDataLayer}, which provides all the methods needed to
interact with the database. It's important to note that a DataLayer
class can only interact with its corresponding entity in the database.

\emph{UnitOfWork} Class (Figure 23): This singular class contains
properties that are instances of DataLayer classes. The BaseService
class implements the UnitOfWork, enabling all service classes to access
the database. This class also includes methods to save changes or
rollback transactions in case of any exceptions at the end of an
application process.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, promoting
maintainability and scalability in the system design.
