\chapter{DEPLOYMENT PLAN}

\section{Deployment}

With the completion of system testing and evaluation, we are now focusing on serving the system to the end users. The deployment plan is structured to ensure a secure, reliable, and efficient operation of all system components.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Backend Deployment}: The backend components mentioned in the system architecture,
    which are Redis Cache, MSSQL Database, Elastic-search Database and API Server,
    are deployed on Azure Cloud Service that provides a secure and 
    reliable solution for our system. This service ensures data integrity and availability, crucial for the systemâ€™s performance.
    As for the Static File Storage, we use a free a cloud of ImgBB.
    \item \textbf{Frontend Deployment}: The front office of our system is deployed on \textit{Vercel}, a cloud server designed for fast and reliable web application deployment. Vercel handles the delivery of the web application to users' browsers, ensuring quick load times and a responsive user experience. This service is ideal for handling web traffic efficiently and maintaining the performance of the frontend interface.
    As for the back office, we use the free cloud provided by Retool to deploy.
\end{itemize}

By deploying the databases, storage, API server and frontend components on these cloud services, we ensure that our system is scalable, secure, and capable of handling user interactions smoothly. This deployment strategy positions us to deliver a high-quality, reliable service to our end users.
